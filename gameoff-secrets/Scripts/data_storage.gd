		"Turbodyne Technologies Internal Competitor Audit of DOXXtech\nCONFIDENTIAL. FOR TURBODYNE USE ONLY.\nSince the last war between Novalift and Carnelian Subspace Systems left a notable gap in the market when Teegarden C was forcibly de-terrraformed, hampering Novalift's core manufacturing facilities, DOXXtech has been making previously unprecidented strides in the home materializer market since the introduction of the Scovex line of materializers. Now, with the announcement of their new D series their stock value stands to skyrocket in comparison to ours. The algorithm and proprietary encription that DOXXtech is using is somehow decades more complex than anything on the market and growing moreso with each iteration they release. Getting our hands on their source code is top priority, but even a decryption key would be leaps and bounds more than we have now. Previous espionage attempts have determined that the algorithm is being developed by a team led by a Dr Graves aboard Mathanwy Station in orbit around Mars. Security at the station is incredibly tight as to be expected, but we do have an agent currently undercover in an unrelated DOXXtech facility that we should be able to get transferred onto the Scovex project.",
		"Confidential Pre-Release Advertising Material. Internal DOXXtech use ONLY.\nHi! Millie Baes here to tell you all about the brand new DOXXtech Scovex D series. The last materializer you’ll EVER need to buy. Guaranteed!\nUnderneath the sleek, modern form factor and high quality, space grade aluminum, DOXXtech has packed this materializer FULL of a revolutionary new form of intelligent construction nanomachines. DOXXtech’s proprietary secret algorithm means that the Scovex D series has no need for tangles of filament or foul smelling liquid resin!\nAll you need to do is open the refill hatch and insert one of the new DOXXtech Scov-matter Bricks. The Scov-matter is odourless, nontoxic, waterproof, and shelf stable for years. BUT WAIT THERE’S MORE!\nThanks to the new Scov-matter Bricks and DOXXtech’s revolutionary nanoswarm AI, the Scovex D series of materializers are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WASTE FREE!\nYou heard me right! One HUNDRED percent waste free! That means no fuss, no stink, no tangles AND no mess. Every single atom of Scov-matter that the materializer uses goes right into the object you’re materialising; which saves you BIG MONEY!",

This is not unusual, Dr Graves frequently asks him to stay late. At 10:34pm, Dr Lowrey returns to the lab off schedule and he spends some time conversing with Dr McCray. Around 11pm, Dr Lowrey is seen giving a shoulder massage to Dr McCray, then at 11:07pm Dr Lowrey leads Dr McCray by the hand to an adjacent supply closet. At 11:24pm, both parties emerge, noticeably dishevelled and Dr Lowrey leaves Dr McCray with an unneccecarily affectionate kiss. Dr McCray leaves the lab at 12:47am after finishing his work. In conclusion, this Officer suspects exactly what anyone with half a functioning brain would suspect. This isn't even the first time the system flagged them doing this.

The Board wants to remind you that this is another milestone year for the company and with the release of the Scovex D series right around the corner they aren't willing to push back the unveiling for as long as you are requesting even if the Board could spare the budget for it. The current containment mesh generators will have to suffice. Besides, with a certified genius like Dr Graves at the helm, the Board is more than certain that you'll be able to achieve the kind of greatness they expect within the outlined budget and timeframe.\n - G. Garreson, Station Operator\nPS-The Board is watching this Scovex project of yours like HAWKS. If you still want that Branch Overseer position, don't push your luck, Vik.",

I barely got your last patch implemented on schedule and this has at least 3 conflicts with existing classes. Can you at least explain where in the matrix generation this is supposed to go?\nComment from T.Graves. 10:32pm: It should work if you call it around line 492 or something. Just make it work, Carl. Vik has been riding my ass about this deadline all week and I have a high priority meeting with the esteemed Dr Scotch tonight.\nComment from C.McCray. 10:34pm: Line 492 is the middle of a priority sorting loop now. Did you mean to call it after that priority check?\nDELETED Comment from C.McCray. 10:46pm: If I see that goddamned invalid call spec message again I'm going to print your dogshit code out on paper and feed it to you.\nComment from C.McCray. 10:48pm: Nevermind. I think I figured it out. It's better but the generation is still showing uneven surfaces. I think if we clamp the secondary calculations higher we can improve the results.\nComment from C.McCray. 11:57pm: Have to push without secondary clamps. If the Board doesn't like it, it's on you.\nComment from T.Graves. 10:38am: Thanks, Carl! You're a real trooper. I'll figure something out for that clamp thing after breakfast."

Dr Lowrey is trying to apologise, but it's my official opinion that he's laying it on a little thick. 11:10pm It appears as though both parties have resolved their differences amicably and Dr Lowrey leaves.

		"Recently digitized from Delft University of Technology physical archives. Flagged for high priority relevance.\nThe following is a partial transcript from a private lecture given by Dr Holsmans to an unknown group approximately two months before his death.\n-and it was on one of those late nights on that radio telescope internship that I first found what I would later come to call the Fornax Signal. It was an intermittent and faint signal that originated, we believe, from somewhere deep in the Fornax Void. Though my seniors at the time were incredulous about the validity of the signal, but I was certaint that it held more complexity than we were initially able to pick up.\nIt would be almost twenty more years before I was put in charge of a telescope powerful enough to discern the truth. The complexity that I was observing was undeniable, but the struggle for the next several decades was decyphering the signal into something legible. While I have signed too many contracts to speak too openly about the details, I am certain at this point that the signal was alien in origin. The Fornax Signal was too long to be a coincidence, too structured to be noise, and unlike anything that we have seen. There is no other conclusion that can be drawn. We are not alone in the universe, and something is trying to make contact.",

		"Subject:Funding Request\nAttatched is a full copy of the audited requirements to continue with safe and secure testing and development. Initial assessments suggest that the adaptive nature of the Scovex nanomachine swarm is far more capable of absorbing and repairing damage than initial projections. A swarm as small as 20 units is capable of infinite replication given the right materials int he right amounts. The swarms show an uncanny degree of autonomy over competitors, but this also requires stronger safety measures. Our containment fields are rated to 22kj, but our projections expect the next few patches to push the Scovex's theorietical max resistance to nearly double the field's rating. If containment measures are breached at the wrong time, if even just a dozen microscopic drones slipped through the containment, we could have an uncontrollable swarm loose. Dr Graves says can survive temperatures in excess of 3000 degrees celcius, more radiation than Chernobyl, and can even shake off the kind of solar flare that knocks out an entire seabord. I don't know if she's exaggerating about that, but the numbers are concerning enough for me to worry if our current measures are sufficient.\n- Vik Massey",

Dr Lowrey is getting predictable. Kinda desperate. Really doesn't look like Dr McCray is having it today though. SO763 mentioned that he and Dr Graves were having an argument about some code update that got pretty heated. Graves wanted him to work over his anniversary. Didn't know Dr McCray was married. Awkward. 10:37pm Dr McCray just accused Dr Lowrey of allegedly using him to leak project data. It didn't sound like any old emotional jab and Dr McCray has been dodging the question like he's in the Matrix. 10:42pm Though the profanity filters won't let me quote Dr McCray directly, he has unequivocally dumped Dr Lowrey and left the lab. I confirmed with IT that he failed to log off before leaving and Dr Lowrey has been left alone in the Scovex Development Core with an unsecured terminal. He's just crying now.

The absolute, unbridled gall of you to put this on my shoulders when the Scvoex swarm is just running your faulty code. If you actually knew what you were doing then you wouldn't always need me to proof your code for hours every night.

Dr Graves approached the containment field in the Scovex Development Core at 5:27pm and the field flickered. It was barely a moment but Dr Graves was, I guess attacked by the swarm.

I wish they had. 5:38pm Paramedics arrive on scene and attempt to resuscitate Dr Graves but she suddenly lunged at them. Her right arm changed. I barely have words for how her flesh and bones were moulded like hot steel by those machines. I saw her eyes when it happened.
